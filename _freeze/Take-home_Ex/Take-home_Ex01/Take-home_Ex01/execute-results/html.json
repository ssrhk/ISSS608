Despite the country's reputation for longevity and a traditionally healthy diet, heart-related health issues—including heart attacks—continue to be a significant public health concern. The impact of heart attacks varies across different age groups, with risk factors and outcomes often differing between younger and older individuals. While Japan’s aging population naturally sees a higher prevalence of heart attacks among adults, recent trends suggest that younger individuals are also increasingly at risk, raising concerns about lifestyle habits and diet.\n\nHistorically, Japan’s diet—rich in fish, vegetables, and low in saturated fats—has been associated with lower cardiovascular disease rates. However, research by Iso (2011) has highlighted a gradual shift toward Westernized dietary patterns, characterized by increased consumption of meat and processed foods, which has contributed to rising cholesterol levels and a greater risk of heart disease. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol consumption have played a role in shaping cardiovascular health trends within the country.\n\nMedical advancements and early interventions have improved survival rates, but the rising burden of cardiovascular diseases still calls for further research and public awareness.\n\n## 1.2 Objectives\n\nThis exercise aims to explore the patterns of heart attacks in Japan across different age groups and shedding light on key factors contributing to their occurrence. By examining trends, potential risk factors, and demographic variations, I seek to provide insights into how heart attack cases differ between youth and adults.\n\nThrough data-driven visualizations, I will highlight the prevalence, underlying causes, and potential warning signs associated with heart attacks in Japan. The goal is to help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public better understand the evolving landscape of cardiovascular health and to encourage proactive measures for prevention and early detection.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2 Methodology & R Packages Used\n\nI will follow the outlined methodology flow for this exercise, starting with data import, followed by data preparation, and concluding with statistical graphics, including exploratory analysis to draw insights.\n\n![](/Take-home_Ex/Methodology.png)\n\nThe following R packages will be used to achieve the objective.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Packages Used\n\n| Package   | Explanation |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| tidyverse |             |\n|           |             |\n|           |             |\n|           |             |\n|           |             |\n|           |             |\n\n## Code to Install and Launch\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 3 The Dataset\n\nThe dataset, *Heart Attack in Japan: Youth vs. Adult,* used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. It contains data for heart attack cases across different age groups.\n\nThis dataset includes 17 variables, both numerical and categorical variables, related to cardiovascular health, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and lifestyle factors. These indicators are crucial in assessing the likelihood of heart attacks and understanding how risk factors differ between younger and older populations.\n\nIn the next section, we will import the raw dataset and refine it further to ensure its readiness for visual analysis and gain deeper insights.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# 4 Data Preparation\n\n## 4.1 Importing the Data\n\nThe code chunk below imports *japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv* into R environment by using *read_csv()* function of **readr** package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheartattack_data <- read_csv(\"data/raw/japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLet's view the structure of the dataset using glimpse() which allows us to see data structure and variable names as well as types.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(heartattack_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 32\n$ Age                     <dbl> 56, 69, 46, 32, 60, 25, 78, 38, 56, 75, 36, 40…\n$ Gender                  <chr> \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Female\", \"F…\n$ Region                  <chr> \"Urban\", \"Urban\", \"Rural\", \"Urban\", \"Rural\", \"…\n$ Smoking_History         <chr> \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Y…\n$ Diabetes_History        <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No…\n$ Hypertension_History    <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No…\n$ Cholesterol_Level       <dbl> 186.4002, 185.1367, 210.6966, 211.1655, 223.81…\n$ Physical_Activity       <chr> \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", …\n$ Diet_Quality            <chr> \"Poor\", \"Good\", \"Average\", \"Good\", \"Good\", \"Go…\n$ Alcohol_Consumption     <chr> \"Low\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", \"High\", \"Hig…\n$ Stress_Levels           <dbl> 3.644786, 3.384056, 3.810911, 6.014878, 6.8068…\n$ BMI                     <dbl> 33.96135, 28.24287, 27.60121, 23.71729, 19.771…\n$ Heart_Rate              <dbl> 72.30153, 57.45764, 64.65870, 55.13147, 76.667…\n$ Systolic_BP             <dbl> 123.90209, 129.89331, 145.65490, 131.78522, 10…\n$ Diastolic_BP            <dbl> 85.68281, 73.52426, 71.99481, 68.21133, 92.902…\n$ Family_History          <chr> \"No\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No…\n$ Heart_Attack_Occurrence <chr> \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\", \"No\"…\n$ Extra_Column_1          <dbl> 0.40498852, 0.03627815, 0.85297888, 0.39085280…\n$ Extra_Column_2          <dbl> 0.43330004, 0.51256694, 0.21959083, 0.29684675…\n$ Extra_Column_3          <dbl> 0.62871236, 0.66839275, 0.61343656, 0.15572404…\n$ Extra_Column_4          <dbl> 0.70160955, 0.11552874, 0.50800995, 0.87025144…\n$ Extra_Column_5          <dbl> 0.49814235, 0.42381938, 0.90066981, 0.39035591…\n$ Extra_Column_6          <dbl> 0.007901312, 0.083932768, 0.227205241, 0.40318…\n$ Extra_Column_7          <dbl> 0.79458257, 0.68895108, 0.49634358, 0.74140891…\n$ Extra_Column_8          <dbl> 0.29077922, 0.83016364, 0.75210679, 0.22396813…\n$ Extra_Column_9          <dbl> 0.49719307, 0.63449028, 0.18150125, 0.32931387…\n$ Extra_Column_10         <dbl> 0.52199452, 0.30204337, 0.62918031, 0.14319054…\n$ Extra_Column_11         <dbl> 0.79965663, 0.04368285, 0.01827617, 0.90778075…\n$ Extra_Column_12         <dbl> 0.72239788, 0.45166789, 0.06322702, 0.54232201…\n$ Extra_Column_13         <dbl> 0.1487387, 0.8786714, 0.1465122, 0.9224606, 0.…\n$ Extra_Column_14         <dbl> 0.8340099, 0.5356022, 0.9972962, 0.6262165, 0.…\n$ Extra_Column_15         <dbl> 0.061632229, 0.617825340, 0.974455410, 0.22860…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAt a glimpse, we note that all variables are in the correct data types.\n\n## 4.2 Filtering for Relevant Variables\n\nWe notice that there were certain columns titled \"Extra_Column\\_\" from column number 18 to 32.
