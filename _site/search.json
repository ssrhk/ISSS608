It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\n\nExplanation of CodeCode\n\n\nThe code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\nTwo steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph.

It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nExplanationCode\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\n\nExplanation of CodeCode\n\n\nThe code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\nTwo steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field.

    "text": "2.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\nSome terminology to note:\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk yourself!\n\n\n\nDoes it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts"

Since our dataset usesa 0 to 10 range, it’s likely a self-reported scale, where 0-3 represents minimal or manageable stress, 4-6 represents moderate stress and 7-10 represents high to extreme stress, with potential health risks.

Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ridgeline Plots Make Sense\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.\n\n\n2.3.3 Interpreting Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 One way ANOVA test: ggbetweenstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“ns” → only non-significant\n“s” → only significant\n“all” → everything\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Significant test of Correlation: ggscatterstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.7 Significant test of Association (Dependence): ggbarstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\nexam1 &lt;- exam %&gt;% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association\n\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER)"

This is likely because Age_08_04 could represent the car’s age, which is inversely related to Mfg_Year (newer cars have smaller ages).\nIncluding both in the model leads to redundancy and instability in coefficient estimates.

While statistically significant, this difference may not be clinically meaningful.\nBMI, Cholesterol Level, Heart Rate, Systolic BP, and Diastolic BP all had p-values greater than 0.05, indicating no significant differences between individuals with and without a heart attack. This suggests that these factors, in isolation, do not show strong evidence of a direct association with heart attack occurrence in this dataset.\nApart from Stress, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between individuals with and without a heart attack for the rest of the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Association of Heart Attack Occurrence with Categorical Factors\n\nDiabetes + Alcohol ConsumptionSmoking + Family HistoryDiet Quality + Physical Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights from Two Sample Mean Tests\n\n\n\n\nThe Welch’s t-test for Stress Level has a p-value of 0.04, indicating a statistically significant difference in stress levels between individuals with and without a heart attack.\nThe mean stress level is slightly lower for individuals who had a heart attack (4.93) compared to those who did not (5.01), but the effect size (g hedges​=0.04) suggests a very small difference. While statistically significant, this difference may not be clinically meaningful.\nBMI, Cholesterol Level, Heart Rate, Systolic BP, and Diastolic BP all had p-values greater than 0.05, indicating no significant differences between individuals with and without a heart attack. This suggests that these factors, in isolation, do not show strong evidence of a direct association with heart attack occurrence in this dataset.\nThere is no clear association observed between the levels of categorical factors like alcohol consumption and heart attack occurrence at a significance level of 5%. For example, low alcohol consumption does not correlate with a lower risk of heart attack, nor does high alcohol consumption correlate with a higher risk for this particular dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Overview of Heart Attack Cases: The Demographics\nWe will first explore the distribution of heart attack occurrences across different age groups and genders in Japan. By categorizing individuals into age groups (Young, Middle-Aged, and Old), we can observe trends in heart attack prevalence, with particular focus on gender differences. This helps identify which demographic groups are more vulnerable and gives us the overview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustment for Age Category Imbalance\n\n\n\nIn section 5.1, it was observed that the Young Age Group (36%) is naturally more represented in the dataset. If we analyze the data without adjustment, this could lead to an overemphasis on the risk of heart attacks among young individuals. To mitigate this potential bias, we will normalize the prevalence of heart attacks within each age group by accounting for their overall representation in the dataset.\nThe prevalence of heart attack in each age category will be normalized using the following formula:\n\\(PrevalenceAgeCat\\) = Number of Heart Attack Cases in Age Group/ Total Individuals in Age Group\nThis adjustment ensures that the analysis of heart attack risk is proportionate to the actual representation of each age group in the dataset, providing more accurate insights into the relationship between age and heart attack prevalence.\n\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Compute total individuals in each age category (from full dataset)\ntotal_age_counts &lt;- heartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(AgeCat) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TotalCount = n())\n\n# Compute number of heart attack cases in each age category (from filtered dataset)\nage_summary &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(AgeCat) %&gt;%\n  summarise(HeartAttackCases = n()) %&gt;%\n  left_join(total_age_counts, by = \"AgeCat\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Prevalence = (HeartAttackCases / TotalCount) * 100)\n\ncustom_colors &lt;- c(\"Young\" = \"#ffe372\", \"Middle-Aged\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Old\" = \"#e79251\")\n\n# Plot 1: Heart Attack Occurrence by Age Category \np1 &lt;- ggplot(age_summary, aes(x = AgeCat, y = Prevalence, fill = AgeCat)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", Prevalence)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +  \n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  labs(x = \"Age Category\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_blank(), \n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank())  \n\n# Compute percentage of Heart Attack Occurrence for each Gender\ngender_summary &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Percentage = (n() / nrow(yesheartattack)) * 100)\n\n# Plot 2: Heart Attack Occurrence by Gender \np2 &lt;- ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = Gender, y = Percentage, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Percentage)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) + \n  labs(x = \"Gender\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(),axis.text.y = element_blank(),axis.title.x = element_blank())+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"#f7a8b8\", \"Male\" = \"#83bace\"))\n\n# Compute total individuals for each Gender-Age category\ntotal_gender_age_counts &lt;- heartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, AgeCat) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TotalCount = n())\n\n# Compute heart attack cases for each Gender-Age category\ngender_age_summary &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, AgeCat) %&gt;%\n  summarise(HeartAttackCases = n()) %&gt;%\n  left_join(total_gender_age_counts, by = c(\"Gender\", \"AgeCat\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Prevalence = (HeartAttackCases / TotalCount) * 100)\n\n# Gender-Age Barplot\np3 &lt;- ggplot(gender_age_summary, aes(x = Gender, y = Prevalence, fill = AgeCat)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +  \n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Prevalence)), \n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Prevalence of Heart Attack Cases (%)\", fill = \"Age Category\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\n(p1 + p2)/ p3 + \n  plot_layout(widths = c(1, 1, 1.5)) +  \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Heart Attack Occurrence by Age Group and Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nMales have a slightly higher proportion of heart attack cases than females, suggesting gender may be a factor.\n\n\n\nAmong those who experienced heart attacks, a higher percentage are in the Middle Aged Group (10.0%).\n\nAmong females, the Old Age Group is the most vulnerable.\nAmong males, the Middle-Aged Age Group appears to be the most vulnerable to heart attacks."

This section aims to narrow our focus from a broad overview of heart attacks to the key lifestyle and health factors that directly contribute to their occurrence. By investigating these factors in more detail, we aim to uncover how individual behaviors, medical histories, and other characteristics interact to influence heart attack risk.\n\n5.2.1 Smoking’s Impact on Heart Attack Occurrence by Age\nSmoking has long been established as one of the most significant risk factors for heart disease, and understanding its impact across different age groups is crucial for targeted interventions. Age plays a vital role in how smoking affects heart health, with younger and older individuals potentially experiencing different risks due to variations in metabolism, vascular health, and overall lifestyle. By examining smoking’s influence on heart attack occurrence across various age groups, we can gain a better understanding of which populations are most vulnerable.\nWe will do this by calculating the rate of heart attacks occurring in each group.

    "text": "4.4 Grouping Variables into Categories\nSome numerical variables (represented as “dbl” when we checked data structure in section 4.1), will be grouped into the following categories for meaningful insights:\n\nAge: For this variable which ranges from 18 to 79, we will use equal bins for each category, categorized as:\n\nYoung: 18–39\nMiddle-Aged: 40–59\nOld: 60–79\n\nCholesterol Level: According to guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) (Lauer et al, 2004), a desirable low cholesterol level is Below 200 mg/dL, a borderline high medium would be between 200 to 239 mg/dL and high cholesterol level is considered as 240 mg/dL and above.To align with this finding, we will categorize as:\n\nLow: 80–199 mg/dL\nMedium: 200–239 mg/dL\nHigh: 240–336 mg/dL\n\nStress Level: A common method to measure stress is the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen,1994) where individuals rate their stress from 0 (no stress) to 10 (extreme stress). Since our dataset usesa 0 to 10 range, it’s likely a self-reported scale, where 0-3 represents minimal or manageable stress, 4-6 represents moderate stress and 7-10 represents high to extreme stress, with potential health risks. Therefore, we will categorize the stress levels as:\n\nLow: 0.000–3.999\nMedium: 4.000–6.999\nHigh: 7.000–10.000\n\nHeart Rate: According to Mayo Clinic, low/below normal heart rate is below 60 bpm, a normal healthy range is 60–100 bpm, and above normal is above 100 bpm. Aligning with this, our categories will be:\n\nLow: 30.000–59.999 bpm\nNormal: 60.000–99.999 bpm\nHigh: 100.000–108.7812 bpm\n\n\n\nheartattack_data &lt;- heartattack_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    AgeCat = case_when(\n      Age &gt;= 18 & Age &lt;= 39 ~ \"Young\",\n      Age &gt;= 40 & Age &lt;= 59 ~ \"Middle-Aged\",\n      Age &gt;= 60 & Age &lt;= 79 ~ \"Old\"\n    ),\n    \n    Cholesterol = case_when(\n      Cholesterol_Level &gt;= 80.0000 & Cholesterol_Level  &lt;= 199.9999 ~ \"Low\",\n      Cholesterol_Level  &gt;= 200.0000 & Cholesterol_Level  &lt;= 239.9999 ~ \"Medium\",\n      Cholesterol_Level  &gt;= 240.0000 & Cholesterol_Level  &lt;= 336.9999 ~ \"High\"\n    ),\n    \n    Stress = case_when(\n      Stress_Levels &gt;= 0.000 & Stress_Levels &lt;= 3.999999 ~ \"Low\",\n      Stress_Levels &gt; 4.000 & Stress_Levels &lt;= 6.999999 ~ \"Medium\",\n      Stress_Levels &gt; 7.000 & Stress_Levels &lt;= 10.000 ~ \"High\"\n    ),\n    \n    HeartRate = case_when(\n      Heart_Rate &gt;= 30.000 & Heart_Rate &lt;= 59.99999 ~ \"Low\",\n      Heart_Rate &gt; 60.000 & Heart_Rate &lt;= 99.99999 ~ \"Normal\",\n      Heart_Rate &gt; 100.000 & Heart_Rate &lt;= 108.78217 ~ \"High\"\n    ),\n    BMICat = case_when(\n      BMI &gt;= 0 & BMI &lt;= 17.999999 ~ \"Underweight\",\n      BMI &gt; 18 & BMI &lt;= 24.999999 ~ \"Normal\",\n      BMI &gt; 25 ~ \"Overweight\"\n    )\n  )"

This helps identify which demographic groups are more vulnerable and gives us the overview.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Compute percentage of Heart Attack Occurrence for each Age Category\nage_summary &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(AgeCat) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Percentage = (n() / nrow(yesheartattack)) * 100)\n\n# Compute percentage of Heart Attack Occurrence for each Gender\ngender_summary &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Percentage = (n() / nrow(yesheartattack)) * 100)\n\n# Define custom colors\ncustom_colors &lt;- c(\"Young\" = \"#cfe7af\", \"Middle-Aged\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Old\" = \"#608e24\")\n\n# Plot 1: Heart Attack Occurrence by Age Category \np1 &lt;- ggplot(age_summary, aes(x = AgeCat, y = Percentage, fill = AgeCat)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Percentage)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +  \n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  labs(x = \"Age Category\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(),axis.title.x = element_blank())  \n\n# Plot 2: Heart Attack Occurrence by Gender \np2 &lt;- ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = Gender, y = Percentage, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Percentage)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) + \n  labs(x = \"Gender\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", plot.title = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(),axis.title.x = element_blank()) \n\n# Plot 3: Heart Attack Occurrence by Age Category in Each Gender \np3 &lt;- ggbarstats(\n  data = yesheartattack,\n  x = AgeCat,\n  y = Gender \n) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_blank()) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n(p1 + p2)/ p3 + \n  plot_layout(widths = c(1, 1, 1.5)) +  \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Heart Attack Occurrence by Age Group and Gender\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nGender and Heart Attack Vulnerability: Males are more prone to heart attacks compared to females, as observed in the dataset.\nStatistical Association between Age Category and Gender: At a 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between Age Category and Gender in relation to heart attack occurrence. This means that, based on the data, age category and gender do not exhibit a strong statistical relationship in predicting heart attack occurrence.\nVulnerability Across Age Groups: The Young Age Group (35.3%) emerges as the most vulnerable to heart attacks across both genders.\n\nAmong females, the Old Age Group is the second most vulnerable.\nAmong males, the Middle-Aged Age Group appears to be the second most vulnerable to heart attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Heart Attack Occurrence by Lifestyle Factors & Medical History\nWe will first conduct Chi-squared test to test for association between each factor with heart attack occurrence to understand the relationships.\n\nBMI CategoryCholesterolStress LevelAlcohol ConsumptionDiabetes HistoryFamily History\n\n\n\nchisq.test(table(heartattack$BMICat, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(heartattack$BMICat, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\nX-squared = 6.3275, df = 2, p-value = 0.04227\n\n\n\n\n\nchisq.test(table(heartattack$Cholesterol, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(heartattack$Cholesterol, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\nX-squared = 0.79632, df = 2, p-value = 0.6716\n\n\n\n\n\nchisq.test(table(heartattack$Stress, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(heartattack$Stress, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\nX-squared = 2.7315, df = 2, p-value = 0.2552\n\n\n\n\n\nchisq.test(table(heartattack$Alcohol_Consumption, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(heartattack$Alcohol_Consumption, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\nX-squared = 3.4314, df = 3, p-value = 0.3298\n\n\n\n\n\nchisq.test(table(heartattack$Diabetes_History, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  table(heartattack$Diabetes_History, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\nX-squared = 1.7, df = 1, p-value = 0.1923\n\n\n\n\n\nchisq.test(table(heartattack$Family_History, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  table(heartattack$Family_History, heartattack$Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\nX-squared = 0.03429, df = 1, p-value = 0.8531\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Chi-squared test results, only BMI Category with a p-value = 0.04 indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship with heart attack occurrence at the 5% significance level. We will also investigate diabetes history since it is close to being statistically significant with a p-value =0.18.

This section visualizes how these factors interact with heart attack risk, providing insights into the relative contributions of each factor. This analysis shows us the importance of lifestyle modifications in preventing heart attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical history, including conditions like diabetes, hypertension, family history of heart disease, and high cholesterol, is a critical determinant of heart attack risk. This section aims to reveal which medical conditions are most strongly associated with an increased risk. For example, individuals with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol levels may be more likely to experience a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights"

This section aims to narrow our focus from a broad overview of heart attacks to the key lifestyle and health factors that directly contribute to their occurrence. By investigating these factors in more detail, we aim to uncover how individual behaviors, medical histories, and other characteristics interact to influence heart attack risk.\n\n5.2.1 Smoking’s Impact on Heart Attack Occurrence by Age\nSmoking has long been established as one of the most significant risk factors for heart disease, and understanding its impact across different age groups is crucial for targeted interventions. Age plays a vital role in how smoking affects heart health, with younger and older individuals potentially experiencing different risks due to variations in metabolism, vascular health, and overall lifestyle. By examining smoking’s influence on heart attack occurrence across various age groups, we can gain a better understanding of which populations are most vulnerable.\nWe will do this by calculating the rate of heart attacks occurring in each group. For instance, Number of Heart Attacks in YoungSmokers/ Total Number of YoungSmokers.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Diabetes & Hypertension Impact by Age (X)\n\n\n5.2.3 BMI vs. Heart Attack with Physical Activity Levels\n\nBMI Distribution (Boxplot + Violin Plot)\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Stress vs. Heart Attack by Gender and Region\n\nBy GenderBy Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nAt lower stress levels (0-1, 1-2), the proportions are relatively high for both genders (11-12%), with males having slightly higher values.\nAt the highest stress level (9-10), females have a noticeably higher proportion (12.01%) compared to males (10.45%).

    "text": "5.2 Zooming in Deeper\nTo gain a deeper understanding of heart attack occurrence, it is crucial to focus on the specific risk factors that contribute to this outcome. This section narrows the scope from a general overview of heart attacks to the key health factors that directly influence their occurrence. By examining these factors more closely, we aim to uncover how individual behaviors, medical histories, and other characteristics interact to shape heart attack risk. Therefore from this point onwards, we will focus on the subset of the dataset who indicated “Yes” for having experienced heart attack.\n\n5.2.1 Vulnerability in Young Individuals: Focusing on BMI and Stress\nIn this section, we delve deeper into the factors influencing heart attack risk among young individuals, as this age group has the highest prevalence of heart attack cases across both genders. As identified in section 5.1.2, BMI plays a crucial role in heart attack occurrences, making it one of the most significant risk factors. Therefore, we now narrow our focus on the distribution of BMI categories within this young demographic, as it offers vital insights into how body weight and composition influence heart attack risk among younger populations.\nFurthermore, we examine the interplay between stress levels and BMI, particularly within the “Overweight” category. Individuals classified as overweight may face an increased vulnerability to stress-related health risks, such as heart attacks. By analyzing how stress levels (Low, Medium, and High) are distributed within the Overweight BMI category, we gain a clearer understanding of how stress contributes to heart attack risk for this group.\nThe decision to focus specifically on the “Overweight” BMI category is driven by its higher prevalence in the data, which provides a more robust and statistically meaningful foundation for analysis. By concentrating on this group, we are able to explore a critical intersection of BMI and stress, which are significant contributors to heart attack occurrences in young individuals.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoung_data &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;% filter(AgeCat == \"Young\")\n\n# Calculate the proportion of each BMI category in young_data\nbmi_proportion_data &lt;- young_data %&gt;%\n  count(BMICat) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n# Distribution of BMI in Young group\nbmi_young &lt;- ggplot(bmi_proportion_data, aes(x = BMICat, y = Proportion, fill = BMICat)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 1)), vjust = 1.5, size = 4) + \n  labs(\n       y = \"Proportion\") +  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Underweight\" = \"#9ddcf2\", \"Normal\" = \"#83bace\", \"Overweight\" = \"#0d8ab7\")) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12), \n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"), \n        plot.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())  \n\n# Calculate the proportion of stress levels within the overweight group\nstress_overweight &lt;- young_data %&gt;%\n  count(Stress) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))  \n\nstress_overweight$Stress &lt;- factor(stress_overweight$Stress, levels = c(\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"))\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart for just overweight\nstress_ow &lt;- ggplot(stress_overweight, aes(x = \"Overweight\", y = Proportion, fill = Stress)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 1)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 4) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Low\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Medium\" = \"#83bace\", \"High\" = \"#f7a8b8\")) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Proportion\", title = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), \n        axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\nbmi_young + stress_ow +\n  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1)) + \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Proportion of BMI and Stress Level in Young Individuals who had a Heart Attack\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nIn young individuals, the Overweight BMI category with Medium stress levels shows the highest proportion of heart attack cases. This suggests a strong correlation between being overweight and experiencing medium levels of stress, which may exacerbate the likelihood of heart attacks. The visualization emphasizes the need for targeted interventions focusing on stress management and weight control in this demographic.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Stress Levels in Gender and Regions\nExploring the influence of both gender and region (urban vs. rural) on heart attack occurrence among overweight individuals with varying stress levels can provide valuable insights into disparities in cardiovascular risk. By examining how gender and region interact with different stress levels, we aim to uncover any significant patterns that may indicate higher vulnerability to heart attacks. Specifically, we will focus on comparing the Medium Stress group (which shows the highest proportion of heart attack cases) with the High Stress group to determine whether stress levels amplify the effects of gender and region in heart attack risk.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter the data for Overweight individuals with Stress levels\nregion_stress_overweight &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(BMICat == \"Overweight\" & Stress %in% c(\"High\", \"Medium\"))\n\n# Calculate the proportion of Stress levels by Region\nproportion_region_stress &lt;- region_stress_overweight %&gt;%\n  group_by(Region, Stress) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = n() / nrow(region_stress_overweight) * 100)\n\n# Region plot\nregions&lt;- ggplot(proportion_region_stress, aes(x = Region, y = Proportion, fill = Region)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Proportion)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Region\", y = \"Proportion (%)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Rural\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Urban\" = \"#e79251\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Stress, ncol = 2) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title=element_blank())\n\n# Calculate the proportion within each Stress level group\nproportion_heartattack &lt;- high_medium_stress_overweight_yes %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress, Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = n() / nrow(high_medium_stress_overweight_yes) * 100)\n\n# Gender plot\ngender&lt;- ggplot(proportion_heartattack, aes(x = Gender, y = Proportion, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Proportion)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Proportion of Heart Attack Cases\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"#f7a8b8\", \"Male\" = \"#83bace\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Stress, ncol = 2) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\n# Filter the data for Overweight individuals\noverweight_data &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(BMICat == \"Overweight\")\n\n# Calculate the proportion of heart attack cases by Gender and Region\nproportion_heartattack_group &lt;- overweight_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, Region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = n() / nrow(overweight_data) * 100)\n\n# Create the bar plot\ngender_reg &lt;- ggplot(proportion_heartattack_group, aes(x = interaction(Gender, Region), y = Proportion, fill = interaction(Gender, Region))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Proportion)), vjust = 1, size = 3,hjust=1.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender-Region Group\", y = \"Proportion of Heart Attack Cases (%)\", \n       title = \"Vulnerability to Heart Attacks by Gender and Region in Overweight Individuals\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Male.Urban\" = \"#0d8ab7\", \"Female.Urban\" = \"#e78090\", \"Male.Rural\" = \"#83bace\", \"Female.Rural\" = \"#f0c6c7\")) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n (gender + regions)/gender_reg + \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Proportion of HeartAttack among Stress Levels by Gender and Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nAmong individuals with Medium and High stress levels, males appear to be more susceptible to heart attacks compared to females, indicating a possible gender-based disparity in how stress influences cardiovascular health. This suggests that men in these stress categories may face a heightened risk of heart disease due to stress.\nIndividuals residing in urban areas are generally more vulnerable to heart attacks than their rural counterparts, regardless of their stress level.\nNotably, the group most at risk is urban-dwelling males, with a heart attack proportion of 36%. They are followed by urban females, with 33.2%. These findings emphasize the combined effect of gender and urban living on heart attack vulnerability, highlighting a need for targeted interventions for males, particularly in urban settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Does Diet Quality and Cholesterol Level Matter?\nBuilding on the previous analysis of gender/region and its impact on heart attack occurrence, it is also crucial to explore the relationship between diet quality and cholesterol levels in the overweight category. Diet quality plays a significant role in influencing cholesterol levels, which in turn, affects the likelihood of heart attacks (Jung et al., 2022). By examining how poor and good diet quality influence cholesterol levels in overweight individuals, we aim to understand how dietary habits contribute to the risk of heart attacks in this group. This analysis will help uncover whether poor diet quality, characterized by higher cholesterol levels, serves as an additional risk factor for heart attacks in overweight individuals, potentially compounding the effects of other health conditions such as stress and gender.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter data for Overweight and Normal BMI groups\nbmi_compare &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(BMICat %in% c(\"Overweight\", \"Normal\"))\n\n# Summarize Diet Quality proportions\ndiet_proportion &lt;- bmi_compare %&gt;%\n  count(BMICat, Diet_Quality) %&gt;%\n  group_by(BMICat) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n# Stacked Bar Chart for Diet Quality\ndiet_plot &lt;- ggplot(diet_proportion, aes(x = BMICat, y = Proportion, fill = Diet_Quality)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 1)), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Diet Quality by BMI Category\",\n       x = NULL, y = \"Proportion\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Poor\" = \"#d73027\", \"Average\" = \"#fc8d59\", \"Good\" = \"#91cf60\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 30, 0, 0),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n# Filter data for Poor and Good Diet Quality groups\ndiet_quality_compare &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(Diet_Quality %in% c(\"Poor\", \"Good\"))\n\n# Calculate median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile for each Diet Quality group\ncholesterol_stats &lt;- diet_quality_compare %&gt;%\n  group_by(Diet_Quality) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    median = median(Cholesterol_Level, na.rm = TRUE),\n    p25 = quantile(Cholesterol_Level, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    p75 = quantile(Cholesterol_Level, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Violin Plot for Cholesterol Levels by Diet Quality\ncholesterol_violin &lt;- ggplot(diet_quality_compare, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = Cholesterol_Level, fill = Diet_Quality)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7) +  # Violin plot for distribution\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", outlier.shape = NA) +  # Small boxplot inside violin\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cholesterol Level (mg/dL)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Poor\" = \"#d73027\", \"Good\" = \"#91cf69\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # Add text labels for median, 25th, and 75th percentiles\n  geom_text(data = cholesterol_stats, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = median, label = sprintf(\"Median: %.1f\", median)), \n            color = \"black\", vjust = -1.5, size = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = cholesterol_stats, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = p25, label = sprintf(\"%.1f\", p25)), \n            color = \"black\", vjust = 1.8, size = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = cholesterol_stats, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = p75, label = sprintf(\"%.1f\", p75)), \n            color = \"black\", vjust = 1.8, size = 2) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n# Density Plot for Cholesterol Levels by Diet Quality\ncholesterol_density_data &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(Diet_Quality %in% c(\"Poor\", \"Good\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Cholesterol_Level, color = Diet_Quality)) +\n  geom_density(size = 1.2) +  # Line density plot\n  labs(title = \"Cholesterol Levels by Diet Quality\",\n       x = \"Cholesterol Level (mg/dL)\", y = \"Density\",\n       color = \"Diet Quality\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Poor\" = \"#d73027\", \"Good\" = \"#91cf60\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0, 1),           \n        legend.justification = c(0, 1),       \n        legend.title = element_blank(),  \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 13)) \n\n\ndiet_plot/(cholesterol_density_data + cholesterol_violin)+\n  plot_layout(widths = c(0.4, 2), heights = c(0.5, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nPoor diet quality is linked to a higher proportion of heart attack cases, with 21% of individuals in the overweight category experiencing heart attacks compared to 18% in the normal weight category. This suggests that individuals with poor diet quality in the overweight group are at a slightly higher risk of heart attacks.\nCholesterol levels tend to be more concentrated around the median in individuals with poor diet quality, indicating a higher density of cholesterol around the middle range. In contrast, good diet quality shows a more even spread of cholesterol levels.\nIndividuals with poor diet quality generally have slightly higher cholesterol levels, with a distribution skewed towards higher values, indicating a potential risk for cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, good diet quality tends to have a more balanced cholesterol distribution.\nThese factors suggest that elevated cholesterol levels due to poor diet quality may contribute to the increased heart attack risk observed in the overweight group."

    "text": "2.6 Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplot Package\n\n2.6.1 Getting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n2.6.2 Working with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. This can be changed by using the method as shown in the code below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Working with layout\ncorrplot() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type = \"lower\", \n         diag = FALSE, \n         tl.col = \"black\",        # Color of text labels\n         tl.pos = \"lt\",           # Position of text labels\n         tl.cex = 1.2,            # Size of text labels\n         tl.offset = 0.5,         # Text label offset\n         cl.pos = \"b\",            # Position of color legend\n         cl.cex = 1.0,            # Size of color legend text\n         cl.offset = 0.5,         # Offset of color legend\n         addCoef.col = \"red\",     # Adds correlation coefficients in red\n         number.cex = 0.8,        # Size of correlation numbers\n         col = colorRampPalette(c(\"red\", \"white\", \"blue\"))(200) # Custom color gradient\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Working with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n2.6.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk b\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\n2.6.6 Reorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "3.4 Creating Interactive Heatmap\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\n\n3.4.1 Working with heatmaply\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\n\n\n3.4.2 Data trasformation\nVariables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\nScaling: It works well when variables have different magnitudes but share a similar underlying distribution. Best for data that follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution and needs to be compared in terms of deviation from the mean.\nNormalizing:Preserves the shape of the original distribution, making it easy to compare variables with different units and scales.Best for data that is not normally distributed and requires a common scale while keeping the relative distances between observations intact.\nPercentize: Helps in ranking values while ensuring that they are comparable without making assumptions about their distribution. Best for when the focus is on relative rankings rather than absolute differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Clustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\n\nManual approach\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow there are 3 Clusters shown on the right side with three different colors.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Seriation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\n\n\nOptimal Leaf Ordering (OLO): This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Working with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.6 The finishing touch\n\nThe ExplanationThe Code\n\n\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "5.2 Zooming in: Vulnerability in Young Individuals\nTo gain a deeper understanding of heart attack occurrence, it is crucial to focus on the specific risk factors that contribute to this outcome. This section narrows the scope from a general overview of heart attacks to the key health factors that directly influence their occurrence. By examining these factors more closely, we aim to uncover how individual behaviors, medical histories, and other characteristics interact to shape heart attack risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTherefore, from this point onwards, we will focus on the subset of the dataset who indicated “Yes” for having experienced heart attack.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Focusing on Stress and BMI\nIn this section, we take a closer look at the role of stress in heart attack risk among young individuals, as this age group has the highest prevalence of heart attack cases across both genders. As identified in section 5.1.1, stress is a significant factor in heart attack occurrences, making it a key area of focus. To further understand its impact, we examine how stress levels (Low, Medium, and High) are distributed across different BMI categories within the young demographic.\nFurthermore, we examine the interplay between stress levels and BMI, particularly within the “Overweight” category. Individuals classified as overweight may face an increased vulnerability to stress-related health risks, such as heart attacks. By analyzing how stress levels are distributed within the Overweight BMI category, we gain a clearer understanding of how stress contributes to heart attack risk for this group. While BMI itself was not found to be a significant predictor, it is important to explore whether stress interacts differently within this subgroup.\nThe decision to focus specifically on the “Overweight” BMI category is driven by its higher prevalence in the data, which provides a more robust and statistically meaningful foundation for analysis. By concentrating on this group, we are able to explore a critical intersection of BMI and stress, which are significant contributors to heart attack occurrences in young individuals.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoung_data &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;% filter(AgeCat == \"Young\")\n\n# Calculate the proportion of each BMI category in young_data\nbmi_proportion_data &lt;- young_data %&gt;%\n  count(BMICat) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n# Distribution of BMI in Young group\nbmi_young &lt;- ggplot(bmi_proportion_data, aes(x = BMICat, y = Proportion, fill = BMICat)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 1)), vjust = 1.5, size = 4) + \n  labs(\n       y = \"Proportion\") +  \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Underweight\" = \"#9ddcf2\", \"Normal\" = \"#83bace\", \"Overweight\" = \"#0d8ab7\")) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 12), \n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"), \n        plot.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())  \n\n# Filter young individuals who are overweight\noverweight_young &lt;- young_data %&gt;% filter(BMICat == \"Overweight\")\n\n# Calculate the proportion of stress levels within the overweight group\nstress_overweight &lt;- overweight_young %&gt;%\n  count(Stress) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))  \n\nstress_overweight$Stress &lt;- factor(stress_overweight$Stress, levels = c(\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"))\n\n# Create the stacked bar chart for just overweight\nstress_ow &lt;- ggplot(stress_overweight, aes(x = \"Overweight\", y = Proportion, fill = Stress)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 1)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 4) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Low\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Medium\" = \"#83bace\", \"High\" = \"#f7a8b8\")) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Proportion\", title = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12), \n        axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\nbmi_young+ stress_ow +\n  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1)) + \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Proportion of Stress Level and BMI in Young Individuals who had a Heart Attack\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\n\n\n\nIn young individuals, the Overweight BMI category with Medium stress levels shows the highest proportion of heart attack cases. This suggests a strong correlation between being overweight and experiencing medium levels of stress, which may exacerbate the likelihood of heart attacks. The visualization emphasizes the need for targeted interventions focusing on stress management and weight control in this particular demographic.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Stress Levels in Gender and Regions\nExploring the influence of both gender and region (urban vs. rural) on heart attack occurrence among overweight individuals with varying stress levels can provide valuable insights into disparities in cardiovascular risk. By examining how gender and region interact with different stress levels, we aim to uncover any significant patterns that may indicate higher vulnerability to heart attacks. Specifically, we will focus on comparing the Medium Stress group (which shows the highest proportion of heart attack cases) with the High Stress group to determine whether stress levels amplify the effects of gender and region in heart attack risk.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter the data for Overweight individuals with Stress levels\nregion_stress_overweight &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(BMICat == \"Overweight\" & Stress %in% c(\"High\", \"Medium\"))\n\n# Calculate the proportion of Stress levels by Region\nproportion_region_stress &lt;- region_stress_overweight %&gt;%\n  group_by(Region, Stress) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = n() / nrow(region_stress_overweight) * 100)\n\n# Region plot\nregions&lt;- ggplot(proportion_region_stress, aes(x = Region, y = Proportion, fill = Region)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Proportion)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Region\", y = \"Proportion (%)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Rural\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Urban\" = \"#e79251\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Stress, ncol = 2) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        plot.title=element_blank())\n\n# Calculate the proportion within each Stress level group\nproportion_heartattack &lt;- high_medium_stress_overweight_yes %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress, Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = n() / nrow(high_medium_stress_overweight_yes) * 100)\n\n# Gender plot\ngender&lt;- ggplot(proportion_heartattack, aes(x = Gender, y = Proportion, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Proportion)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Proportion of Heart Attack Cases\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"#f7a8b8\", \"Male\" = \"#83bace\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Stress, ncol = 2) + \n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\n# Filter the data for Overweight individuals\noverweight_data &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(BMICat == \"Overweight\")\n\n# Calculate the proportion of heart attack cases by Gender and Region\nproportion_heartattack_group &lt;- overweight_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, Region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Proportion = n() / nrow(overweight_data) * 100)\n\n# Create the bar plot\ngender_reg &lt;- ggplot(proportion_heartattack_group, aes(x = interaction(Gender, Region), y = Proportion, fill = interaction(Gender, Region))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Proportion)), vjust = 1, size = 3,hjust=1.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender-Region Group\", y = \"Proportion of Heart Attack Cases (%)\", \n       title = \"Vulnerability to Heart Attacks by Gender and Region in Overweight Individuals\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Male.Urban\" = \"#0d8ab7\", \"Female.Urban\" = \"#e78090\", \"Male.Rural\" = \"#83bace\", \"Female.Rural\" = \"#f0c6c7\")) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n (gender + regions)/gender_reg + \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Proportion of HeartAttack among Stress Levels by Gender and Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nAmong individuals with Medium and High stress levels, males appear to be more susceptible to heart attacks compared to females, indicating a possible gender-based disparity in how stress influences cardiovascular health. This suggests that men in these stress categories may face a heightened risk of heart disease due to stress.\nIndividuals residing in urban areas are generally more vulnerable to heart attacks than their rural counterparts, regardless of their stress level.\nNotably, the group most at risk is urban-dwelling males, with a heart attack proportion of 36%. They are followed by urban females, with 33.2%. These findings emphasize the combined effect of gender and urban living on heart attack vulnerability, highlighting a need for targeted interventions for males, particularly in urban settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Does Diet Quality and Cholesterol Level Matter?\nBuilding on the previous analysis of gender/region and its impact on heart attack occurrence, it is also crucial to explore the relationship between diet quality and cholesterol levels in the overweight category. Diet quality plays a significant role in influencing cholesterol levels, which in turn, affects the likelihood of heart attacks (Jung et al., 2022). By examining how poor and good diet quality influence cholesterol levels in overweight individuals, we aim to understand how dietary habits contribute to the risk of heart attacks in this group. This analysis will help uncover whether poor diet quality, characterized by higher cholesterol levels, serves as an additional risk factor for heart attacks in overweight individuals, potentially compounding the effects of other health conditions such as stress and gender.\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter data for Overweight and Normal BMI groups\nbmi_compare &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(BMICat %in% c(\"Overweight\", \"Normal\"))\n\n# Summarize Diet Quality proportions\ndiet_proportion &lt;- bmi_compare %&gt;%\n  count(BMICat, Diet_Quality) %&gt;%\n  group_by(BMICat) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))\n\n# Stacked Bar Chart for Diet Quality\ndiet_plot &lt;- ggplot(diet_proportion, aes(x = BMICat, y = Proportion, fill = Diet_Quality)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(Proportion, accuracy = 1)), \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Diet Quality by BMI Category\",\n       x = NULL, y = \"Proportion\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Poor\" = \"#d73027\", \"Average\" = \"#fc8d59\", \"Good\" = \"#91cf60\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 30, 0, 0),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n# Filter data for Poor and Good Diet Quality groups\ndiet_quality_compare &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(Diet_Quality %in% c(\"Poor\", \"Good\"))\n\n# Calculate median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile for each Diet Quality group\ncholesterol_stats &lt;- diet_quality_compare %&gt;%\n  group_by(Diet_Quality) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    median = median(Cholesterol_Level, na.rm = TRUE),\n    p25 = quantile(Cholesterol_Level, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    p75 = quantile(Cholesterol_Level, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n# Violin Plot for Cholesterol Levels by Diet Quality\ncholesterol_violin &lt;- ggplot(diet_quality_compare, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = Cholesterol_Level, fill = Diet_Quality)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7) +  # Violin plot for distribution\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, fill = \"white\", outlier.shape = NA) +  # Small boxplot inside violin\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"Cholesterol Level (mg/dL)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Poor\" = \"#d73027\", \"Good\" = \"#91cf69\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # Add text labels for median, 25th, and 75th percentiles\n  geom_text(data = cholesterol_stats, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = median, label = sprintf(\"Median: %.1f\", median)), \n            color = \"black\", vjust = -1.5, size = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = cholesterol_stats, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = p25, label = sprintf(\"%.1f\", p25)), \n            color = \"black\", vjust = 1.8, size = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = cholesterol_stats, aes(x = Diet_Quality, y = p75, label = sprintf(\"%.1f\", p75)), \n            color = \"black\", vjust = 1.8, size = 2) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  guides(fill = \"none\")\n\n# Density Plot for Cholesterol Levels by Diet Quality\ncholesterol_density_data &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(Diet_Quality %in% c(\"Poor\", \"Good\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Cholesterol_Level, color = Diet_Quality)) +\n  geom_density(size = 1.2) +  # Line density plot\n  labs(title = \"Cholesterol Levels by Diet Quality\",\n       x = \"Cholesterol Level (mg/dL)\", y = \"Density\",\n       color = \"Diet Quality\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Poor\" = \"#d73027\", \"Good\" = \"#91cf60\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0, 1),           \n        legend.justification = c(0, 1),       \n        legend.title = element_blank(),  \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 13)) \n\n\ndiet_plot/(cholesterol_density_data + cholesterol_violin)+\n  plot_layout(widths = c(0.4, 2), heights = c(0.5, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nPoor diet quality is linked to a higher proportion of heart attack cases, with 21% of individuals in the overweight category experiencing heart attacks compared to 18% in the normal weight category. This suggests that individuals with poor diet quality in the overweight group are at a slightly higher risk of heart attacks.\nCholesterol levels tend to be more concentrated around the median in individuals with poor diet quality, indicating a higher density of cholesterol around the middle range. In contrast, good diet quality shows a more even spread of cholesterol levels.\nIndividuals with poor diet quality generally have slightly higher cholesterol levels, with a distribution skewed towards higher values, indicating a potential risk for cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, good diet quality tends to have a more balanced cholesterol distribution.\nThese factors suggest that elevated cholesterol levels due to poor diet quality may contribute to the increased heart attack risk observed in the overweight group."

Is the dataset balanced in terms of heart attack cases versus non-cases?\nNext, we examine the distribution of gender—are males and females equally represented? Similarly, we analyze the regional distribution to determine whether rural and urban populations are proportionally represented.\nUnderstanding these proportions is crucial, as any significant imbalance could influence our analysis and the generalizability of our findings.

    "text": "5.3 Zooming in: Vulnerability in Young vs Old Individuals\nUnderstanding heart attack vulnerability requires examining how risk factors differ across age groups. Young and old individuals present distinct physiological, behavioral, and lifestyle characteristics that influence heart attack risk. Young individuals may experience heart attacks due to factors such as stress, lifestyle habits, or underlying conditions, while older individuals often face risks associated with long-term health issues, including hypertension, cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease.\nBy focusing on these two age groups, we aim to uncover key differences in how heart attacks manifest and what factors contribute most significantly to their occurrence. This targeted approach allows us to explore whether certain risk factors, such as stress, have a stronger impact in one group over the other, ultimately providing more age-specific insights into heart attack prevention and management.\n\n5.3.1 Focusing on Stress\nStress is a well known contributor to heart disease, but its impact may vary depending on age. In young individuals, stressors such as work pressure, financial concerns, and lifestyle choices may lead to sudden cardiovascular strain, increasing heart attack risk. In contrast, for older individuals, chronic stress and cumulative health burdens can contribute to long-term cardiovascular deterioration.\nGiven the significance of stress in heart attack occurrences, as identified in Section 5.1.2, this section examines how stress levels differ between young and old individuals and whether these variations influence heart attack vulnerability. By analyzing these distinctions, we can better understand whether stress acts as a more immediate or gradual risk factor across different age demographics.Adjustment for Stress Category Imbalance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs found in section 5.1, in our dataset, the Stress category distribution is imbalanced, with the following proportions:\n\nMedium: 53%\nLow: 31%\nHigh: 16%\n\nIf we use the Stress categories as they are, the medium category would be disproportionately represented. To ensure more accurate insights and avoid overemphasizing the medium stress group, we will normalize the data before visualizing. This normalization will be done using the following formula:\n\\(NormalizedStress\\) = Young (or Old) in each Stress Category with experience of Heart Attack​/ Total Number of each Stress Category in those who have experienced Heart Attack\nBy applying this normalization, we adjust for the imbalances in Stress category distributions and ensure that each age group’s Stress categories are represented proportionally within the context of heart attack cases.\n\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Compute total number of \"Yes\" Heart Attack cases in each Stress category\ntotal_stress_counts &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TotalCount = n())\n\n# Count the number of \"Yes\" Heart Attack cases for each AgeCat and Stress category\nage_stress_counts &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(AgeCat %in% c(\"Young\", \"Old\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(AgeCat, Stress) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n(),.groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Join the counts with the total Stress counts to calculate normalized proportions\nnormalized_stress &lt;- age_stress_counts %&gt;%\n  left_join(total_stress_counts, by = \"Stress\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(NormalizedStressProportion = Count / TotalCount)\n\n# Plot normalized Stress proportions for each AgeCat\nstressplot &lt;- ggplot(normalized_stress, aes(x = AgeCat, y = NormalizedStressProportion, fill = Stress)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +  \n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", NormalizedStressProportion * 100)), \n            position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), vjust = 1.5, size = 2) +  \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Low\" = \"#ffcccc\", \"Medium\" = \"#83bace\", \"High\" = \"#608e24\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Age Category\", y = \"Normalized Stress Proportion\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        legend.title= element_text(size=5),\n        legend.text= element_text(size=5),\n        plot.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n# Filter for Young and Old categories\nheartattack_filtered &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  filter(AgeCat %in% c(\"Young\", \"Old\"))\n\n#Distribution of stress in Young/Old\n# Calculate the statistics\nstats &lt;- heartattack_filtered %&gt;%\n  group_by(AgeCat) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    median = median(Stress_Levels),\n    Q1 = quantile(Stress_Levels, 0.25),\n    Q3 = quantile(Stress_Levels, 0.75),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n# Boxplot\nstress_box&lt;- ggplot(heartattack_filtered, aes(x = AgeCat, y = Stress_Levels, fill = AgeCat)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_text(data = stats, \n            aes(x = AgeCat, \n                y = median, \n                label = paste(\"Median:\", round(median, 2))), \n            position = position_nudge(y = 0.5), size = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = stats, \n            aes(x = AgeCat, \n                y = Q1, \n                label = paste(\"25th Percentile:\", round(Q1, 2))), \n            position = position_nudge(y = -0.5), size = 2) +\n  geom_text(data = stats, \n            aes(x = AgeCat, \n                y = Q3, \n                label = paste(\"75th Percentile:\", round(Q3, 2))), \n            position = position_nudge(y = 0.5), size = 2) +\n  labs(\n       x = \"Age Category\",\n       y = \"Stress Level\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Young\" = \"#ffe372\", \"Old\" = \"#e5ae85\"))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n#Anova\nanova_stress &lt;- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = yesheartattack,\n  x = AgeCat, \n  y = Stress_Levels,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)+\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\nanova_stress+stress_box+stressplot + \n  plot_layout(widths = c(1, 0.8, 0.8)) +  \n  plot_annotation(title = \"Stress Level in Young and Old Individuals who had a Heart Attack\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nWhen conducting a Welch’s one-way ANOVA test to examine the relationship between Stress levels and Age categories among heart attack patients, the test resulted in a p-value of 0.02, indicating a significant difference in stress levels between young and old patients. On average, older patients had a higher stress level (mean = 5.07) compared to younger patients (mean = 4.83).\nBoxplot analysis further supports this finding, showing that older patients have a higher median stress level of 5.19, whereas younger patients have a median of 4.83. Additionally, the interquartile range (IQR) is higher for older individuals, meaning both the 25th and 75th percentiles of stress levels are elevated in this group.\nWhen examining stress categories, young heart attack patients were most commonly found in the Low Stress category, with 38.2% of cases. In contrast, older individuals had a greater proportion of heart attack cases in the Medium and High Stress categories. This aligns with the boxplot observations, reinforcing that older heart attack patients generally experience higher stress levels compared to younger patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Stress Levels in Blood Pressure\nBlood pressure is a critical indicator of cardiovascular health, and its relationship with stress is well-documented in medical research. Higher stress levels have been associated with fluctuations in blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart-related complications, including heart attacks (Gordon & Mendes,2021).\nIn this section, we examine how diastolic blood pressure varies across different stress levels among young and old individuals. By analyzing these patterns, we aim to understand whether stress contributes differently to blood pressure changes across age groups. Identifying such differences can provide insights into the physiological impact of stress and its potential role in heart attack risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFYI! Why Diastolic BP is important\n\n\n\nSystolic blood pressure reflects the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats, while diastolic blood pressure reflects the pressure between beats when the heart is at rest. Diastolic pressure is often used in clinical settings to gauge the health of the blood vessels and heart’s ability to relax. Given the context of this study, which seeks to explore the impact of stress on heart function, diastolic blood pressure provides a more relevant and sensitive measure of how stress affects the body’s ability to regulate blood flow.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis - BP vs StressDistribution of Diastolic BP in Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nThe spread (IQR) of diastolic BP is wider for young individuals across all stress levels, meaning their BP varies more compared to older individuals. The density plots (overlaid KDE) show that the diastolic BP distribution is slightly more concentrated for older individuals, suggesting more consistency in their BP readings.\n\n\n\nThe analysis reveals a significant correlation between stress and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), with a p-value of 0.02 indicating that stress levels do indeed have an effect on DBP. The correlation coefficient (R) of -0.04 suggests a very weak negative relationship between stress and DBP, implying that, on the whole, higher stress levels are slightly associated with lower diastolic blood pressure. However, looking at the 95% confidence interval for the correlation, which ranges from -0.08 to -0.008, we can conclude that while the relationship between stress and DBP is statistically significant, its strength is not substantial.\nWhen delving into the distribution of DBP across stress levels in different age categories, there are interesting patterns:\n\nFor young individuals, there is no clear increasing or decreasing trend in median BP across stress levels. The median BP remains relatively stable (around 79-80 mmHg).\n\n\n\nFor older individuals, there is an inverse relationship between stress and diastolic BP:\n\nOlder individuals with low stress have the highest median BP (81.2 mmHg).\nThose with high stress have a lower median BP (79 mmHg).\nThis could suggest that older individuals under stress might have physiological or behavioral responses (e.g., lifestyle changes, medication adherence) that lower BP.\nIn elderly individuals, very low DBP (&lt;60 mmHg) is linked to an increased risk of heart failure because the heart may not get enough oxygenated blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Does Gender and Regions Matter in Stress?\nExploring the influence of both gender and region (urban vs. rural) on heart attack occurrence with varying stress levels can provide valuable insights into disparities in cardiovascular risk. By examining how gender and region interact with different stress levels, we aim to uncover any significant patterns that may indicate higher vulnerability to heart attacks.\nLet’s first see the distribution of gender and region proportions in each stress level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustment for class imbalances in Gender and Region of Stress Levels\n\n\n\nAs found above, if we use the Region and Gender as it are, the Male and Urban category would be disproportionately represented. To ensure more accurate insights and avoid overemphasizing certain groups, we will normalize the data before visualizing. This normalization will be done using the following formulas:\n\\(StressRegion\\) = Number of heart attack cases in each Stress-Region group/ Total number of cases in the same stress category\n\\(StressAge\\) = Number of heart attack cases in each Stress-Age group/ Total number of cases in the same stress category\n\\(GenderRegion\\)= = Number of heart attack cases for each Gender-Region combination/ Total number of heart attack cases in that region\nThis ensures that:\n\nUrban and Rural are weighted fairly (not dominated by Urban cases).\nGender imbalances within Urban vs. Rural are accounted for (not dominated by Male)\n\n\n\n\nThe PlotThe Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Normalize the proportion by Region and Gender\nnormalized_proportion_heartattack_reg &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress, Region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(HeartAttackCases = n()) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress) %&gt;%\n  mutate(TotalHeartAttackCasesStress = sum(HeartAttackCases)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(NormalizedProportion = HeartAttackCases / TotalHeartAttackCasesStress * 100)\n\n# Region plot with normalized proportions\nregion &lt;- ggplot(normalized_proportion_heartattack_reg, aes(x = Region, y = NormalizedProportion, fill = Region)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", NormalizedProportion)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Region\", y = \"Normalized Proportion of Heart Attack Cases\",\n       title = \"Normalized Proportion of Heart Attack Cases among Stress Levels by Region\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Rural\" = \"#9cc567\", \"Urban\" = \"#e79251\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Stress, ncol = 3) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_blank())\n\n# Normalize the proportion by Stress and Gender\nnormalized_proportion_heartattack &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress, Gender) %&gt;%\n  summarise(HeartAttackCases = n()) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Stress) %&gt;%\n  mutate(TotalHeartAttackCasesStress = sum(HeartAttackCases)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(NormalizedProportion = HeartAttackCases / TotalHeartAttackCasesStress * 100)\n\n# Gender plot with normalized proportions\ngender &lt;- ggplot(normalized_proportion_heartattack, aes(x = Gender, y = NormalizedProportion, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", NormalizedProportion)), vjust = 1.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender\", y = \"Normalized Proportion of Heart Attack Cases\",\n       title = \"Normalized Proportion of Heart Attack Cases among Stress Levels by Gender\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = \"#f7a8b8\", \"Male\" = \"#83bace\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Stress, ncol = 3) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_blank())\n\n# Normalize the proportion of heart attack cases by Gender and Region\nnormalized_proportion_heartattack_group &lt;- yesheartattack %&gt;%\n  group_by(Gender, Region) %&gt;%\n  summarise(HeartAttackCases = n()) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Region) %&gt;%\n  mutate(TotalHeartAttackCasesRegion = sum(HeartAttackCases)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(NormalizedProportion = HeartAttackCases / TotalHeartAttackCasesRegion * 100)\n\n# Create the bar plot with normalized proportions\ngender_reg &lt;- ggplot(normalized_proportion_heartattack_group, aes(x = interaction(Gender, Region), y = NormalizedProportion, fill = interaction(Gender, Region))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", NormalizedProportion)), vjust = 1, size = 3, hjust = 1.3) +\n  labs(x = \"Gender-Region Group\", y = \"Normalized Proportion of Heart Attack Cases (%)\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Male.Urban\" = \"#0d8ab7\", \"Female.Urban\" = \"#e78090\", \"Male.Rural\" = \"#83bace\", \"Female.Rural\" = \"#f0c6c7\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_blank()) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n(gender + region) / gender_reg+\n  plot_annotation(title = \"Proportion of Heart Attack Cases among Stress Levels by Gender and Region\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights\n\n\n\n\nNotably, the group most at risk is rural-dwelling males, with a heart attack proportion of 52.3%.
